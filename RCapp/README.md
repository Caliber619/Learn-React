# RC Arbeiter 🚀  
**A Smart Room Cleaning Token Management System**  

## 📌 Project Overview  
RC Arbeiter is an **automated room cleaning request & tracking system** designed to streamline the process of **assigning, tracking, and verifying room cleaning tasks** in a structured environment such as hostels, dormitories, or office spaces.  

Students can **generate cleaning requests**, managers can **assign workers**, and workers can **confirm task completion using a simple OTP-based system**, ensuring transparency and efficiency in task management.  

---  

## ⚡ How It Works?  

### 🏫 Student Panel  
- 🎟️ **Generate Token** – Students request room cleaning by entering details like **Room Number, Time, Registration Number, and Name**.  
- 🆔 **Receive a Completion ID (C-ID)** – Each token comes with a unique **C-ID**, which acts as an **OTP for task completion**.  

### 👨‍💼 Manager Panel  
- 🔍 **View Requests** – The manager sees all generated cleaning requests (tokens).  
- 👷 **Assign Workers** – Assign workers to specific cleaning requests.  
- ➕ **Add New Workers** – The system auto-generates **Worker IDs** for new workers.  
- ❌ **Cancel Requests** – If needed, the manager can **remove requests** from the queue.  

### 🛠️ Worker Machine Panel  
- 📥 **Enter C-ID & Worker ID** – After completing a task, the worker enters the **C-ID (OTP) & their Worker ID** to confirm the work.  
- ✅ **Task Completed** – The system updates the manager about the completed task.
